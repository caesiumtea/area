# Area calculator

Simple Python program to calculate the area of a triangle, rectangle, square, or circle.

Based on a challenge from [Codedex.io](https://www.codedex.io/python)

Challenge instructions:  
> Create a calculator.py program that calculates the area of one of the following shapes:
> 
>     Square
>     Rectangle
>     Triangle
>     Circle
> 
> The program should present a menu for the user to choose which shape to calculate, then ask them for the appropriate values (side, length, width, etc.).
> 
> Then, it should calculate the area and print it out.

I extended the instructions by adding input validation and a loop to repeat the program.
